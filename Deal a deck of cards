Step 1 - Create a list for a standard deck of cards,
Step 2 - Randomly choose five cards to add to a player's hand,
# print out the number of cards in the list that represents the deck. Finally, print out the cards in the player's hand.



import random
suits = ["Hearts", "Spades", "Clubs", "Diamonds"]
ranks = ["2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10", "Jack", "Queen", "King", "Ace"]
deck = []

for  suit in suits:
  for rank in ranks:
    deck.append(f'{rank} of {suit}')

print(f'There are {len(deck)} cards in the deck.')
number_of_cards_choosen = int(input("Enter How Many Cards You Want To Choose : "))
print('Dealing ...')

hand = []  # length of this list will be equal to number of cards choosen after appending the items from while loop
while len(hand) < number_of_cards_choosen:
    card = random.choice(deck)
    deck.remove(card)
    hand.append(card)

print(f'There are {len(deck)} cards in the deck.')
print('Player has the following cards in their hand:')
print(hand)
